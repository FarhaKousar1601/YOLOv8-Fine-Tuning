### YOLOv8 Person Detection and Counting

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model specifically for detecting and counting persons in images and videos. The project was undertaken by Nabeel Arain and Mir Hasnain, showcasing the effectiveness of YOLOv8 in real-world applications.

**Model Description**

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is an advanced object detection model that excels in accuracy and speed. It's designed to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from images in a single evaluation, making it suitable for real-time detection tasks.

**Project Highlights**

- **Dataset Preparation:** Curated and annotated a comprehensive dataset focused on the persons class.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Applied transfer learning techniques to fine-tune YOLOv8 for high-precision person detection.
- **Validation Testing:** Conducted rigorous testing on a validation dataset to ensure performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were met.
- **Implementation:** Deployed the model to detect and count persons in images and video sequences.

**Outcomes**

- **Accurate Person Detection:** Achieved significant improvements in detecting persons with high confidence scores.
- **Real-Time Counting:** Enabled reliable person counting in video streams.
- **Scalable Solution:** Demonstrated efficiency and scalability for integration into larger systems.
